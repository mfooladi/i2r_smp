Please run continuous_system/simulation_fully.py or continuous_system/simulation_uni.py for the simulation.

continuous_system/triangle_plot.py
	1. Plots trinagles
	2. Return triangles x and y values
	3. It is used in simulation for drawing the triangles
continuous_system/vector_field.py
	1. Returns the vector field for any point in the 2D environment
	2. Plots the vector field 
	3. Its input is state_order_{geometry}.txt
continuous_system/simulation_fully.py
	1. Simulates a fully-actuated robot
	2. Has an input : geometry_name. 
	3. Plases choose 'C' or 'D' as the geomtry_name
continuous_system/simulation.uni.py
	1. Simulates a unicycle robot
	2. Has an input : geometry_name. 
	3. Plases choose 'C' or 'D' as the geomtry_name
discrete_system/discrete_path_plannar.py
	1. Constructs the triangulations
	2. Constructs the transition systems
	3. Outputs the discrete system state order
	4. Input is the a {geometry_name}.poly file 
misc/vector_field_demo.py
	1. Illustrates vector fields for a sample triangle
misc/point_in_triangle
	1. Demonstrates whether or not a point is within a triangle
